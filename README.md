# Exploratory Data Analysis and Outlier Detection 
# Overview
This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and outlier detection on a dataset named train.csv. The steps include identifying outliers, analyzing the data using various visualizations, and handling missing data. The process is conducted using Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# Key Steps
**1. Outliers**
Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset. Detecting and handling outliers is crucial for ensuring the robustness of statistical analyses and machine learning models.

**Process:**
Quantile Calculation: Calculate the first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles for numerical columns in the dataset.
Interquartile Range (IQR): Compute the IQR as the difference between Q3 and Q1.
Outlier Definition: Define outliers as data points that fall below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR.
Outlier Identification: Identify rows in the dataset that contain outliers.
**2. Exploratory Data Analysis**
EDA involves summarizing the main characteristics of the dataset, often using visual methods. It helps in understanding the distribution, patterns, and relationships within the data.

**Process:**
Loading Data: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Statistical Summary: Generate a summary of the dataset using describe() and info() methods.
Five-Number Summary: Calculate the minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum for the numerical columns.
Visualizations: Create various plots to visualize the data, including:
Box Plots: Visualize the distribution of numerical columns and highlight outliers.
Scatter Plots: Show the relationship between two numerical variables.
Line Plots: Display trends in numerical variables.
Histograms: Illustrate the distribution of a numerical variable.
Bar Plots: Compare categorical data.
Pie Charts: Represent the proportion of categories.
**3. Filling the Missing Data**
Handling missing data is a crucial step in data preprocessing. Missing data can affect the analysis and model performance.

**Process:**
Identifying Missing Data: Check for missing values in the dataset.
Filling Missing Data: Replace missing values with a specified value (e.g., 0) using the fillna() method.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to exploratory data analysis, outlier detection, and handling missing data. By following these steps, you can gain valuable insights from the dataset and prepare it for further analysis or modeling.
